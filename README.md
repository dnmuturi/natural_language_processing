Automated Support Ticket Categorization Using Generative AI
Project Overview

In today’s dynamic business environment, customer feedback is a critical driver of product improvement, customer satisfaction, and long-term growth. Organizations receive large volumes of support tickets and customer messages daily, making it challenging to identify urgent issues, prioritize effectively, and respond in a timely manner.

This project addresses that challenge by leveraging Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the classification and processing of customer support tickets. Instead of manually reviewing and sorting tickets, the system intelligently analyzes incoming text to extract insights and guide decision-making.
